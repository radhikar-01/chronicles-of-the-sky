# Chronicles of the Sky
Two Player Platform Game inspired by Greek Mythology!

Created in 2021, this was my final project for HarvardX's Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Game Development.

This 2D platform game is inspired by childhood favorites like Fireboy & Watergirl, and features art and music from various opensource platforms!

You can check out a video of me playing through the game at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nksgWZSduRU
